\begin{acknowledgements}
First, I would like to thank my parents, Douglas and Carolyn, my brother Michael, and my girlfriend Athena for their constant support.

I am very grateful to Professor Donald Greenberg for providing me with the opportunity to study at the Cornell Program of Computer Graphics. The knowledge, experience, and opportunities I have gained throughout the degree would not have been possible without someone as incredible as Don running the show.

I would like to thank Professor Kavita Bala for providing me with many opportunities to expand my knowledge of computer graphics. I would also like to thank her for being an advisor on my thesis committee.
